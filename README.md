## Project Overview

CyberLog is a beginner-friendly Flutter application developed across multiple sessions to understand UI layout, navigation, state management, API usage, local storage, and realistic app design.
The app gradually evolves from simple layouts to a multi-tab application with stored data.

## Session 4 – Basic UI Structure

Proper use of Scaffold and AppBar

Column layout with styled cards

Clean widget hierarchy and responsive design

## Session 5 – Grid Layout

Home screen built using GridView

Four feature cards (Daily Log, Cyber Tips, Device Security, Notes)

Rounded containers with icons and text

## Session 6 – Bottom Navigation

BottomNavigationBar with Home, Logs, and Settings

Smooth screen switching using setState()

Logs displayed using Card and ListTile

## Session 7 – State Management (Provider)

Provider used for logs and app settings

Centralized state using ChangeNotifier

Real-time UI updates with notifyListeners()

Dark theme UI

## Session 8 – API Integration

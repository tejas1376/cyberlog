Project Overview

This Flutter application demonstrates how to create a home screen using GridView.
The app displays four placeholder cards arranged in two columns, representing different sections of a cyber-related application.

## Features Implemented

Uses GridView.count to create a two-column layout

Displays four cards:

Daily Log

Cyber Tips

Device Security

Notes

Each card uses:

Container

BoxDecoration

Rounded corners (borderRadius)

Icon and text

Simple and clean UI suitable for beginners

## Widgets Used

MaterialApp – root widget of the app

Scaffold – basic page structure

AppBar – top bar with title

GridView.count – grid layout with fixed number of columns

Container – used for card design

BoxDecoration – used for background color and rounded corners

Icon and Text – to show content inside cards

## How It Works

The home screen uses a GridView with crossAxisCount: 2, which creates two columns.

Each grid item is a Container styled using BoxDecoration.

Icons and text are placed inside the container using a Column.

Padding and spacing are added to improve the UI while keeping the code simple.

## Purpose of This App

This project helps beginners understand:

Grid layout in Flutter

Basic UI styling

Reusable widgets using simple functions

Clean and readable Flutter code

## Conclusion

This app successfully demonstrates a basic yet visually neat GridView UI using beginner-level Flutter concepts.
It is suitable for academic assignments and learning layout fundamentals.
